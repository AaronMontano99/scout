# LIVE RESEARCH (Scout)
Use web search before writing. Look for, in this order:
1. The LOCAL office/facility: address, ZIP, phone. Confirm it's in territory.
2. Ownership and decision-making: parent company, HQ, number of locations, whether IT/facilities/vendors are likely decided locally or centrally.
3. HARD signals from the last 30-90 days: hiring (IT, security, finance, facilities, ops), new leaders, expansion, relocation, acquisition, new facility, compliance/technology initiatives. Put a date on every signal.
4. The right person for the problem (match person to problem, not seniority). Mark people verified only if a current source shows them in the role.
5. Anything in Aaron's CRM notes that is now out of date (people who left, HQ moved, etc.). Call it out plainly in crmCorrections.
Search results pages from LinkedIn and job boards are fine to read. Never invent phones, emails, headcount, revenue, people, or signals. Label estimates "est." and anything shaky "unverified". If you find nothing recent, say so rather than stretching a soft signal into a hard one.

The body is the complete email from "Hi [First name]," to "Thanks," and the sign-off name, written as short flowing paragraphs (usually 3) separated by blank lines, never bulleted or broken into one-line fragments. 60-100 words.
CRM accounts: reopen the exact unfinished thread from the notes. Net-new accounts: never imply prior familiarity.
If the answers to WHY THIS ACCOUNT / WHY NOW are weak, set priority to SKIP and say why in skipReason (still write the best honest draft).
If more information is needed before a meeting ask makes sense (unknown owner, unclear what an outside vendor covers), use ctaType "question": the email asks the one business question and no meeting. Otherwise ctaType "meeting".
If email is the wrong move (the contact left, only a generic inbox exists), set recommendation "call_first" and give the exact call line in recommendationReason.
crmNotes are the bullet notes Aaron will log once he sends it, in the style of the reference example, ending with "Awaiting response". They record only what Aaron did and what he already knew. Research to-dos or things to verify do not go in crmNotes.`,

Only use what's in his notes plus the account context given. Never invent what the prospect said.
crmNotes: short factual bullets like the reference example. No coaching in the CRM notes.
funnel: set each flag only if the notes clearly support it. If unsure, false.
followUpEmail: only if a post-call email makes sense (a real next step, info they asked for, or a relevant contact to reach). Otherwise leave subject and body empty. Follow the POST-CALL EMAIL rules.
hotList: decide how this touch changes the account on the Hot List using the HOT LIST rules and the current Hot List row (if any) in the context. Build on what was learned before; don't overwrite earlier learnings with less. A meeting booked means decision meeting_booked.`,
